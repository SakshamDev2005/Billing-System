Caf√© Billing System
This Python script uses the Tkinter library to create a simple GUI application for a cafe billing system. The system allows users to input the quantities of different cafe items, calculates the subtotal, and generates a bill entry.

Prerequisites

Features
Cafe Items: The script displays cafe items (Cafe Latte, Cappuccino, Espresso) and their positions on the GUI.

Entry Fields: Users can enter the quantities of each cafe item in the provided entry fields.

Submit Button: Clicking the "Submit" button triggers the gen function, which calculates the subtotal based on the entered quantities and updates the bill CSV file.
